<p>As an long time blogger and open source software advocate, I highly suggest learning about my skills from other related sources. The software I write, information I publish, and technology I advocate paint a better picture of what I do and love about my craft. Please checkout my github accounts (<a href="http://github.com/metaskills/">metaskills</a> or <a href="http://github.com/rails-sqlserver/">rails-sqlserver</a>) or a list of my gems on <a href="https://rubygems.org/profiles/246">rubygems.org</a>.</p>

<h4 id="influences-amp-values">Influences &amp; Values</h4>

<ul>
<li>A hardcore aversion to complexity.</li>
<li>Solving low level problems in isolation to maintain high focus.</li>
<li>Only using 3rd-party code that is written well &amp; tested.</li>
<li>Reading source code as documentation.</li>
<li>Teaching! The best avenue to learning.</li>
<li>Performing occupational maintenance.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="summary">Summary</h4>

<p>Software developer that loves problem solving using Ruby, JavaScript/CoffeeScript, or Objective-C. Previous careers in ops, marketing and <a href="/2011/09/11/revisiting-my-design-past/">design</a> combine to add value at all levels. I take ownership of my tasks, have a strong work ethic, and require no hand holding. So whether it is a low level database stack or a high level user interface design, I am right at home.</p>

<h4 id="highlights-of-qualifications">Highlights of Qualifications</h4>

<p><strong>PROGRAMMING SKILLS:</strong> Authored and collaborated on numerous open source projects in all these languages. To date, I have been programming web applications using Ruby and JavaScript for 10 years. My HTML/CSS skills far exceed most programmers since I have been developing web sites for 19 years and have been doing semantic and unobtrusive presentation layer CSS for 11 years.</p>

<p><strong>TOOLS OF THE TRADE:</strong> UNIX is my integrated development environment, specifically a Mac using ZSH shell with Sublime Text 3. I currently use rbenv and Pow for my local development stack with a back-end of MacPorts for anything else. Yes, MacPorts! I happen to like the /opt sandbox concept which keeps Apple&#39;s OS upgrades from hosing my dynamically linked dependencies. Git is the only SCM I like, but I have experience in many others.</p>

<p><strong>PEOPLE SKILLS:</strong> I love to work with talented people! Even more so, I like to teach and help others learn about the things I myself love to do. I am currently the organizer for the <a href="http://757rb.org/">Norfolk Ruby User&#39;s Group (757.rb)</a> where we give talks each and every month. Teaching others and writing articles is not only enjoyable, but helps me stay current with my craft.</p>

<p>Implemented some basic steps to moving the organization to a more service oriented design by defining API layers, single sign on solutions, and development setups. Built internal tools for their pharmacist call queue using Spine.JS that heavily leveraged WebSockets and Server Send Events to keep all clients synchronized. The JavaScript application was developed on top of a new Rails application back-end along with a Ruby client gem that opened up APIs for this new service to legacy RoR applications.</p>

ActionMoniker is my personal entity for doing any type of software consulting or personal projects. Its name is an homage to 37signals&#39; Nametron 3000&trade;. A list of personal projects are included below.</p>

<p><a href="http://homemarks.com/">HomeMarks</a> is a AJAX start page geared towards todo or project-based bookmarking. The idea is a throwback to the HTML start pages we developers made for ourselves going back to 1996. I use HomeMarks as a way of staying on top of Rails best practices by rewriting much of it every few years. About 7 years ago I wrote v2.0 by building my own <a href="http://bit.ly/w0ljee">MVC JavaScript framework</a> and moving the Rails application to follow a <a href="http://bit.ly/hJYfNA">service oriented design</a>. This put me years ahead of frameworks such as Backbone.js or SproutCore. Shortly afterward, I build my first <a href="http://itunes.com/apps/homemarks">iPhone application</a> using HomeMarks new service layer and I have subsequently given talks to local and distant groups on how to integrate RESTful Rails applications with iOS&#39; Core Data framework. I am currently writing v3.0 with an emphasis on Spine.JS and CoffeeScript on top of an HTML5/CSS3 web layer that utilizes Sass &amp; Compass CSS framework and my own hand coded CSS animations and transitions.</p>

<p>MetaSkills.net is my own blog hosted on GitHub and published via a static site generator written in Ruby called Jekyll. It is written in HTML5/CSS3 standards and leverages some snazzy mobile first styles along with some technical SVGs.</p>

</h4>

<p><img src="/assets/resume/profexp-decipher.png" class="ms-Img ms-Img--half" />
As the sole developer created a multi-tenant Rails eCommerce application tailored for the coupon industry. Due to the unique nature of the digital goods, virtual inventorying and security, the entire application included strict business rules on the monthly inventory per retailer campaign that had timeout hooks in the front end shopping cart. Digital goods were compiled and delivered via a custom Java application per transaction that created serialized coupons with barcodes for that specific transaction by the central Rails application. Made extensive use of ImageMagick and the GNU Barcode Ruby wrappers. Developed payment processing utilizing both the direct and express checkout methods of PayPal&#39;s NVP API.</p>

<p>Built a community marketing site for the company&#39;s upcoming trading card game (TCG) called FightKlub. The majority of my involvement for this application involved developing customizations to Mephisto/Beast and deploying them into production. These sites can be currently found at <a href="http://www.decipher.com/">decipher.com</a> and include Prototype animations, custom liquid templates, and core extensions to Beast to register new founding mentors.</p>

<p>Moved entire company from Microsoft ActiveDirectory/Exchange services to Apple XServes using OpenDirectory/Postfix/Cyrus. Also moved all non legacy .Net applications and websites to those existing XServes. Troubleshooted critical routing errors by predecessors and firewall configurations which also involved setting up new gigabit Cisco equipment to maintain companies DMZ and existing VLANs to offsite warehouses. Learn how I even <a href="http://bit.ly/okqcDZ">setup my own home network</a> way back in the day using Mac Minis.</p>

<ul>
<li>Working With Rails Prior 1.0 Release</li>
<li>Expert Level ImageMagick Usage</li>

<p>I successfully integrated all revenue and marketing channels into a trackable system that utilized a combination of their proprietary systems, 3rd party conversion tools, new custom code that captured and reported on aggregate data. A summary of these channels include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Retention Marketing System</li>
<li>Search Marketing (Organic &amp; PPC)</li>
<li>Affiliate Program &amp; Comparison Shopping Portals</li>
<li>Online &amp; Offline Media Placement</li>
<li>Virtual Drop Shippers</li>
<li>Incentivised Loyalty Program</li>
</ul>

<p>Completely overhauled the entire pay-per-click search engine (PPCSE) and affiliate marketing systems into a successful prospecting engine within 8 weeks time. Built and integrated conversion tracking code that identified campaign success to the keyword level and post-conversion metrics into the retention marketing system for up to one year past the initial conversion. Benefits of the new systems also reported on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Product Category Performance</li>
<li>Ad Copy Response</li>
<li>Cart Bailout Metrics</li>
<li>Click Fraud Sources</li>
<li>Negative Keyword Terms</li>
<li>Continuous Data Through the PayPal IPN</li>
<li>Relevant Online Partnerships via AdSense &amp; Publisher Referrals</li>
</ul>

<p>Continually maximized PPCSE marketing from an average of 300 terms to over 30,000 terms and phrases with a 275% increase in buyers and overall campaign profitability. Added conceptually driven keyword campaigns and matching ad copy that captured nearly every tangible search a consumer would find offers and products. This was achieved using a combination of creative thinking at the consumer level and mining corporate date into datafeed campaigns that were dynamically driven by SKU metadata. Deployed keyword buys over the following 1st and 2nd tier PPCSEs, note that 3rd tier PPCSEs are rampant with click fraud and are not included Google, Overture (now YSMS!), MSN, Kanoodle, and the Kaboose Kids Search</p>

<p>Revamped the affiliate marketing program from a passive ad-hoc system that was frequently abused by self-referrals to a managed, proactive, lead generation engine for online partnerships. Established myself as a visible program manager that affiliates could interact with. Encouraged growth by usage of good communications and publishing writing bi-monthly newsletters that contained informative articles on how to maximize and use the more advanced technical aspects of the program. Acquired power affiliates and relevant online partnerships that increased the programs direct sales up 500% with value added buyers into the retention marketing system.</p>
